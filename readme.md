## ZMK Configuration for Handwired, Wireless Skeletyl
This repository contains custom ZMK configuration for handwired [Skeletyl](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Skeletyl) build. The build log for the entire keyboard itself can be found [here](https://elescia.wordpress.com/2022/02/27/handwired-wireless-skeletyl/).

Do note that the keymap file under `boards/shield/skeletyl/` is the *default* keymap, while the one under `config/` is the one that will be compiled if it exists. It is heavily advised to leave the default keymap as it is and make your custom changes in the files under the `config/` directory.
